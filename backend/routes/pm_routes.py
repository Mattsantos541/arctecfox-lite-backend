- **Asset Name**: {data.name}
- **Model**: {data.model}
- **Serial Number**: {data.serial}
- **Asset Category**: {data.category}
- **Usage Hours**: {data.hours} hours
- **Usage Cycles**: {data.cycles} cycles
- **Environmental Conditions**: {data.environment}

Use the manufacturer's user manual to determine recommended maintenance tasks and intervals. If the manual is not available, infer from similar equipment in the same category.

For each PM task:
1. Clearly describe the task.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions.
3. Include safety precautions.
4. Note any relevant government regulations or compliance checks.
5. Highlight common failure points this task prevents.
6. Tailor instructions based on the provided usage and environmental conditions.

The plan should be easy for a technician to follow, with helpful notes and context when needed."""
